# poblano_count_words_app
This app counts the number of words in a sentence (or text)

You must install `pytest`, `pytest-cov` and `coverage` using `pip install`

To test the code just type: `pytest`

To measure coverage type: `pytest --cov`

To output coverage into a html `coverage html`

The immediate command above creates a folder known as `htmlcov`. Inside this folder exists the file `index.html`

You can then open the above html file using a browser of your choice e.g. `firefox htmlcov/index.html`
